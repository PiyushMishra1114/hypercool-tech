💡 About HyperCool Tech
At HyperCool Tech, we believe cooling should be affordable, efficient, and built to last.
 Traditional air conditioners are costly and power-hungry — fans are cheap but hardly cool 
the room.
 We bridge that gap.
Our flagship product, the PG-Liquid Cooled Fan System, blends liquid cooling, evaporative 
design, and smart automation into one compact unit. It runs on 12 V DC, making it perfect 
for both urban homes and rural areas where energy and cost matter most.
We design with purpose — low power, high impact, repairable locally, and built for real 
people.
⚙️ How It Works
Visual idea: a 3-step flow with simple icons or animation.
1.  Smart Airflow: Air enters through a dust filter and evaporative pad.
2.  Liquid Cooling: Heat is absorbed by a copper coil and carried by our PG-liquid coolant.
3.  Heat Rejection: The heated liquid flows to an external mini radiator, where twin fans 
release the heat outdoors.

🔬 Innovation Section
Every HyperCool unit is a result of hundreds of design iterations.
 We engineered an internal water loop that mimics industrial chillers — but scaled it down, 
simplified it, and made it run on 12 V.
 Our system is:
Low-cost to manufacture.
Low-energy to operate.
High in repairability and accessibility.

                                    (It’s not just a cooler. It’s an innovation built for future India.)

❓ FAQ
Q1: How much can it cool a room?
 → In a 10×12 ft closed room, expect a 5–8 °C drop within 60–90 minutes (ambient 30 °C → 
inside 22–25 °C).
Q2: Can it run without a compressor?
 → Yes — liquid cooling + airflow removes heat efficiently with no refrigerants.
Q3: Can I power it with solar?
 → Absolutely. One 50 W panel with a 12 V battery will run it easily.
Q4: Is it noisy?
 → Under 38 dBA at normal mode — quieter than a table fan.
Q5: What’s the lifespan?
 → Designed for 3–5 years of continuous use with minimal maintenance.
